## Summary of Critical Gaps
1. Authentication system needs to be production-ready with full registration and password management
2. Dashboard requires real data integration and advanced visualizations
3. Core features like 360-degree evaluations, idea bank, and notifications are only partially implemented
4. Advanced features like AI analytics, development modules, and continuous feedback are missing entirely
5. Mobile responsiveness and accessibility need significant improvement
6. Admin capabilities are incomplete
7. Third-party integrations are not implemented
8. Comprehensive testing and documentation are missing

## Recommendations
1. Prioritize core functionality (authentication, dashboard, evaluations) for immediate implementation
2. Establish proper API contracts between frontend and backend
3. Implement comprehensive testing strategy
4. Focus on mobile-first responsive design
5. Develop reusable UI component library
6. Create detailed technical documentation for each feature
7. Plan integration points early in the development process
